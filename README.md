# About me
<p> Hello, my name is Eduardo and I am a programming enthusiast, currently at a basic level and in constant search for knowledge. In addition, I have a passion for watching anime, eating sweets, and exploring the fascinating fields of mathematics and philosophy. At the same time, I am dedicating myself to improving my English, reaching an intermediate level. I'm excited to share my learning journey here on GitHub and look forward to contributing to interesting projects.</p>
